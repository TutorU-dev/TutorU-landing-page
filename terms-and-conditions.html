      <h3><b>Terms and Conditions</b><h3>

      <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the TutorU app (“TutorU” or the “Service”). Please read these Terms carefully and contact us if you have any questions. By downloading or using TutorU, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our <a href="./privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h4><b>Our Service</b></h4>
      <p>TutorU is committed to providing a useful platform to connect students and student tutors. To do that, we show you content we think will be relevant to you based on your onsite activity. To provide our Service, we need to be able to identify you and your preferences. Some of the things we show you may be promoted by advertisers. As part of our service we try to ensure that even promoted content is relevant and interesting to you. You can identify promoted content because it will be clearly labelled.</p>

      <h4><b>Using TutorU</b></h4>
      <p>You may use TutorU only if you can legally form a binding contract with TutorU, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. When you create your TutorU account, you must provide us with accurate and complete information. You can’t use Good Vibes if it would be prohibited by U.S. sanctions. Any use or access by anyone under the age of 13 is not allowed. If you’re based in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you may only use Good Vibes if you are over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your country or if verifiable parental consent for your use of TutorU has been provided to us. Using TutorU may include downloading software to your phone, tablet, or other device. You agree that we may automatically update that software, and these Terms will apply to any updates.</p>

      <h4><b>License</b></h4>
      <p>Subject to these Terms and our policies, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use our Service.</p>

      <h4><b>Content</b></h4>
      <p>TutorU allows you to post content, including a profile photo, personal information, links, direct messages, and other materials. Anything that you post or otherwise make available on TutorU is referred to as "User Content." You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to TutorU. You grant TutorU and our users a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, save, display, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute your User Content on TutorU solely for the purposes of operating, developing, providing, and using TutorU. Nothing in these Terms restricts other legal rights TutorU may have to User Content, for example under other licenses. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content, or change the way it’s used in TutorU, for any reason. This includes User Content that we believe violates these Terms. Even if you terminate your account or remove User Content, we reserve the right to keep your User Content for a reasonable period of time. TutorU and its users may retain and continue to use, save, display, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute any of your User Content that other users have stored or shared on TutorU. User feedback is incredibly important to us. TutorU is committed to adapting to what our audience wants, and we are always interested in learning about ways we can make TutorU better. If you choose to submit User Content, you agree that we are free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you. By accepting your submission, TutorU doesn’t waive any rights to use similar or related feedback previously known to TutorU, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.</p>

      <h4><b>Security</b></h4>
      <p>We care about the security of our users. While we work to protect the security of your content and account, TutorU can’t guarantee that unauthorized third parties won’t be able to defeat our security measures. We ask that you keep the password to your associated email account secure. Please notify us immediately of any compromise or unauthorized use of your account. If you believe your account has been compromised, contact us immediately and try resetting your password.</p>

      <h4><b>Third Party Services</b></h4>
      <p>TutorU may contain links to third party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by TutorU. While we work to make sure our advertisers and affiliates are thoroughly vetted, we don’t endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access any third-party website, service, or content from TutorU, you do so at your own risk and you agree that TutorU has no liability arising from your use of or access to any third-party website, service, or content.</p>

      <h4><b>Termination</b></h4>
      <p>TutorU may terminate or suspend your right to access or use TutorU for any reason on appropriate notice. There is absolutely zero tolerance for posting objectionable content or abusing our service. We may terminate or suspend your access immediately and without notice if we have a good reason, especially if you post objectionable content.</p>

      <h4><b>Disclaimers</b></h4>
      <p>Our Service and all content on TutorU is provided on an "as is" basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied. TutorU specifically disclaims any and all warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade. TutorU takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other person or third-party posts or sends using our Service. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that’s inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose. If you're a consumer in the EEA, we don’t exclude or limit any liability for gross negligence, intent, or death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct.</p>

      <h4><b>Limitation of Liability</b></h4>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TUTORU SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL TUTORU’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). If we cause damage to you and you're a consumer in the EEA, the above doesn’t apply. Instead, TutorU’s liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. TutorU isn’t liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability won’t apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct, or if and to exclude our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you.</p>

      <h4><b>Governing Laws and Jurisdiction</b></h4>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. If you are not a consumer in the EEA, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is Washtenaw County, Michigan and our dispute will be determined under Michigan law. If you are a consumer in the EEA, this won’t deprive you of any protection you have under the law of the country where you live and access to the courts in that country.</p>

      <h4><b>General Terms</b></h4>
      <p>We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if that’s what we decide. We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our discretion, is material, we’ll notify you. By continuing to access or use TutorU after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the new Terms. If you don’t agree to the new terms, please stop using TutorU. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by TutorU without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void. If you’re a consumer in the EEA, either you or TutorU may assign this agreement, and any rights and licenses granted under it, to a third party. In case of such an assignment by TutorU, you are entitled to terminate the agreement with immediate effect by deactivating your account. TutorU will provide you with reasonable notice of any such assignment. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with TutorU shall constitute the entire agreement between you and TutorU concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Good Vibes’ failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

      <p>Effective January 5th, 2020.</p>
